# Hangman-Game-in-Python code update available
This is a simple Hangman game using Python programming language.
The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words.
When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible.
In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances.
